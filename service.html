  <h2>SERVICES</h2>
  <h4>What we offer</h4>
  <br>
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm-4">
      <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-cutlery"></span>
      <h4>Dishwashers</h4>
      <p>Depending on the nature and logistics of your event, dishwashing services may be required to keep the event running smoothly.
	  If your caterer can offer this service at a highly professional level, 
	  it can often save you money. If not, you may need to hire a different company to provide dishwashers, which can drive up your costs.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-4">
      <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-glass"></span>
      <h4>Bartenders</h4>
      <p>Many special occasions call for bartending services, whether it’s a cash bar or a crowd-pleasing “open” bar. Catering companies who can provide 
	  bartending services, in addition to maintaining a strong reputation 
	  where it counts most (meal service), tend to be experienced and adept at realizing the full potential of your special event.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-4">
      <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-user"></span>
      <h4>Waiters</h4>
      <p>Buffet service is popular with many customers. It saves money, and it’s more appropriate for many events. But there are also occasions where waitstaff 
	  may be a better bet ­– and for these events, it’s important to find a caterer who lives up to the highest expectations. If the waitstaff aren’t working at a super professional level, 
	  it can impact your event in a very negative way. When it’s done right, however, waitstaff can truly elevate any formal occasion.</p>

      <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-leaf"></span>
      <h4>Delivery</h4>
      <p>Sometimes there are events where you don’t actually want or need catering staff on site. In these cases, having your food and drink
	  delivered can be a very economical and sensible option. Most caterers include delivery with all of 
	  their buffet menus, but you’ll want to make sure the fee structures are clear when you seek delivery services from a catering company.</p>

    <div class="col-sm-4">
      <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-music"></span>
      <h4>Entertainment</h4>
      <p>If you’re organizing a children’s party, or another event where entertainment is needed, you might assume that you’ll need to hire a different 
	  contractor for those services. Many catering companies partner with entertainment providers, however, and can provide you with good, 
	  affordable, professional options. Examples include magicians, clowns, and disc jockeys.</p>
